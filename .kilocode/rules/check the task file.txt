# check the task file.txt

If you cannot find the python bindings of a java file, it may not be implemented, then end the task.

## Guidelines

- If you cannot find the pythong bindings of a java file, look at its corresponding task file
- If it is just implemented as a rust trait it may not have python bindings
- The task file might indicate that python bindings were not made
- Finish the task
